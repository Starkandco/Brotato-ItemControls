# Brotato-ItemControls
Item Controls mod for Brotato

Adds a very basic menu (visible at difficulty options section before each run) which enables user to add or remove items/weapons/upgrades) from the games pools for the run.

Comes with an enable/disable button to allow easy revert to the normal pools.

Does not allow user to remove an element if it is the last element of that type for that tier. For example, the one consumable in the game cannot be removed from its list as this breaks the list for consumables (at common tier to be explicit).

Note - does not save the selection of the user if the game is closed. I aim to implement this in the near future.
