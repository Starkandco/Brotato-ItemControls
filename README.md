# Brotato-ItemControls
Item Controls mod for beta version of Brotato

*NOTES:
- Set up for co-op not working fully yet (can't select the menu (IN CO-OP) but pre-configured set ups from setting up in single player will work)
- 
Adds a very basic menu (visible at difficulty options section before each run) which enables user to add or remove items/weapons/upgrades from the games pools for the run.

Comes with an enable/disable button to allow easy revert to the normal pools.

Does not allow user to remove an element if it is the last element of that type for that tier. For example, the one consumable in the game cannot be removed from its list as this breaks the list for consumables (at common tier to be explicit).
